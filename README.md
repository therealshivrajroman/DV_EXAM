## Dataset used

## Objective
The goal is to create a dynamic and interactive dashboard that provides insights into the impact of
food-related activities across different regions in India. The dashboard should enable decision-makers to
identify trends, analyze top-performing categories, and assess geographic and temporal patterns
effectively.

## Key Business Questions
1. Total Overview: What is the overall scale of the dataset (e.g., number of records, total values for
key metrics)?
2. Top Performers: Which food items/categories/regions contribute the most to a specific metric
(e.g., sales, impact value)?
3. Temporal Trends: How do key metrics (e.g., production or impact) vary over time?
4. Geographic Insights: How do the key metrics distribute across regions in India?
5. Dynamic Analysis: How can filters (e.g., by year, region, or category) refine the analysis and
provide actionable insights?

## Features Required in the Dashboard
1. Data Aggregation: Summarize the total values for key metrics like production, impact, or sales.
2. Top-N Analysis: Identify the top 5 or 10 contributors to the metrics, displayed through bar or
column charts.
3. Trend Analysis: Plot trends for metrics over time to identify patterns and seasonality.
4. Geographic Visualization: Use a map visual to display data based on regions or states in India,
with tooltips for details.
5. Interactive Elements:
○ Slicers for filtering by year, category, or region.
○ Dynamic visuals that respond to slicer selections.
○ A KPI or card to highlight key metrics (e.g., YoY change, totals).
